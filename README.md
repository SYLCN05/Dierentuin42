# Virtual Zoo Project




## Introduction

This project is the second part of our final assignment in the C# learning trajectory. The goal is to apply our C# knowledge and skills by developing a web application and an API. In this assignment, we demonstrate our proficiency in the basic aspects of C# programming as well as the frameworks and tools associated with it.

## Project Description

We have created a virtual zoo where users can manage the zoo. It is possible to create animals, set up enclosures for the animals, and categorize the animals for easy searching. Additionally, users can perform various actions such as:

- Creating a new layout
- Completing an existing layout
- Setting feeding times
- Triggering sunrise and sunset
- Checking if all conditions are met

## Frameworks and Tools Used
- ASP.NET Core Web App (Model-View-Controller): We implemented the MVC design pattern to structure our application.
- Entity Framework: Used for database management, allowing us to perform CRUD operations efficiently.
- .NET 8.0: The latest version of .NET, providing improved performance and new features.
- API Controllers: Built a robust API to handle all user actions and operations.
- Razor Pages: Used for creating dynamic web pages.
- Migrations and Seeding-Data: Implemented to ensure the database can be set up and populated with initial data easily.

## Key Functionalities
*Animals (Animal)*

CRUD operations on animals
Searching/filtering by properties
Actions such as Sunrise, Sunset, Feeding time, and CheckConstraints

*Categories (Category)*

CRUD operations on categories
Assigning animals to a category
Searching/filtering by category

*Enclosures (Enclosure)*

CRUD operations on enclosures
Assigning animals to an enclosure
Actions such as Sunrise, Sunset, Feeding time, and CheckConstraints

*Zoo (Zoo)*

Actions such as Sunrise, Sunset, Feeding time, and CheckConstraints
AutoAssign action for automatically assigning animals to enclosures


## What We Have Learned

During this project, we learned how to develop a web application and API using C#. We gained experience in applying the MVC design pattern, using Entity Framework for database management, and implementing various functionalities such as CRUD operations and user actions. Additionally, we learned how to structure our code according to Microsoft coding conventions and how to build a secure and efficient web application.
